# 🃏 Blackjack Game in Python

Welcome to my simple Blackjack game built with Python! This is a console-based implementation of the classic card game, where you play against the dealer.

## 🎯 Objective

Try to beat the dealer by getting a hand total as close to **21** as possible, without going over.

## 📦 Features

- Standard Blackjack rules
- Player vs Dealer logic
- Card shuffling and dealing
- Input validation
- Game loop for replayability

## 🚀 Getting Started

To play the game, simply clone the repository and run the Python script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blackjack-game.git
cd blackjack-game
python blackjack.py

---

If you'd like, I can customize this based on:
- whether your game uses object-oriented programming
- if there’s a GUI or it's CLI-only
- or if you want to add installation instructions via `pip`, etc.

Let me know how detailed you want it!
